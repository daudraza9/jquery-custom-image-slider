In this project, Iâ€™ve implemented a custom jQuery image slider.
Fetches random placeholder images from a website.
Applies random colors to the images.
Auto color-changing functionality using setInterval.
Styled "Next" and "Previous" buttons for manual navigation between images.
Combines jQuery with creative design elements for a dynamic user experience.
